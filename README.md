 # Which Food Has More
 
_Fun web application using jquery to ask user to pick between two foods which has more added sugar, calories, or saturated fat._

This is a more challenging project for me. It was a collaborative project. I received help with the backend code and used HTML & CSS to design the frontend myself. 

###### Which Foods Has More uses food from [Food-pedia](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/food-pedia), a database of a variety of foods and their nutritional content.
