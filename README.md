 # Which Food Has More
 
This is a fun web application using jquery to ask user to pick between two foods which has more added sugar, calories, or saturated fat.

This is my most challenging project and was a collaborative effort. I received help with the backend code and used HTML & CSS to design the frontend myself. 

###### Which Foods Has More uses food from [Food-pedia](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/food-pedia), a database of a variety of foods and their nutritional content.
