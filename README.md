 # Which Food Has More
 
This is a small game that asks the user to compare two foods and guess which has more added sugar, calories, or saturated fat.

This was was a collaborative effort. I received help with the jquery code and used HTML & CSS to code the frontend myself. 

###### Which Foods Has More uses food from [Food-pedia](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/food-pedia), a database of a variety of foods and their nutritional content.
